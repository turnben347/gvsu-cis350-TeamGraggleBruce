## 1 Abstract

With the growing trend of mobile applications abandoning support for smart-home devices, users are left without reliable control over their connected homes. This project addresses this issue by developing a robust desktop application designed to ensure long-term control over smart-home lighting systems, independent of third-party apps that may lose support in the future. Our solution focuses on creating a user-friendly interface that allows seamless control over smart-home lights, offering features such as brightness adjustment, color changes, and scheduled automation. By eliminating the reliance on volatile mobile apps, this desktop application provides a stable and future-proof platform, empowering users to manage their smart-home lighting systems efficiently and with confidence for years to come.
